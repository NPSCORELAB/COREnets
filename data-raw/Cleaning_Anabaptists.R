early Anabaptist leaders."

.abstract <- "Religiously motivated violence is and always will be a relevant 
topic. To address and effectively counter contemporary violent groups, it is 
important to investigate similar historic groups. This thesis attempts to answer 
the research question: 'During the Radical Reformation, why did some Anabaptist 
groups accept the use of violence while others did not, and how did the movement 
evolve to pacifism?' To answer this question, this study utilizes a mixed 
methodology of case study analysis and social network analysis of Anabaptist 
leaders during the 16th century. This thesis argues that violent ideology is 
largely a function of three factors: charismatic leadership, isolation, and 
apocalypticism. The interaction of these factors led to the emergence of 
Anabaptist groups that embraced the use of violence. However, groups' internal 
characteristics can also lead them away from violence. In the case of the 
Anabaptists, social proximity assisted leaders with a counter-message to speak 
effectively to violent ultra-radical factions. The goal of this thesis is to 
identify characteristics of religious groups that may signal the potential for 
future violence, while also providing insight into which leaders may be capable 
of re-directing groups that have become violent."
