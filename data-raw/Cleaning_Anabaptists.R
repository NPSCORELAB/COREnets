Together with the dataset on the beliefs of early Anabaptist leaders and groups, it 
can be used to examine the diffusion of theology and ideas among early Anabaptist 
leaders."

.abstract <- "Religiously motivated violence is and always will be a relevant topic. To 
address and effectively counter contemporary violent groups, it is important to 
investigate similar historic groups. This thesis attempts to answer the research 
question: 'During the Radical Reformation, why did some Anabaptist groups accept the 
use of violence while others did not, and how did the movement evolve to pacifism?' To
answer this question, this study utilizes a mixed methodology of case study analysis 
and social network analysis of Anabaptist leaders during the 16th century. This thesis 
argues that violent ideology is largely a function of three factors: charismatic 
leadership, isolation, and apocalypticism. The interaction of these factors led to the
emergence of Anabaptist groups that embraced the use of violence. However, groups' 
internal characteristics can also lead them away from violence. In the case of the 
Anabaptists, social proximity assisted leaders with a counter-message to speak 
effectively to violent ultra-radical factions. The goal of this thesis is to identify 
characteristics of religious groups that may signal the potential for future violence, 
while also providing insight into which leaders may be capable of re-directing groups 
that have become violent."
