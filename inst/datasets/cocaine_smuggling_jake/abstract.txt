These data refer to one of four illicit drug networks operating in Spain between 2007 and 2009. Operation JAKE (n=62) took place in 2008, the group investigated was operating as a wholesale supplier and retail distributor of cocaine and heroin in a large distribution zone located in Madrid, Spain, where gypsy clans traditionally carry out similar activities. The group was in charge of acquiring, manipulating and selling the drugs in the gypsy quarter.  The information is listed as coming from police wiretapping and meetings registered by police investigations of the dark network.

This data was reconstructed from Jimenez-Salinas Framis, A. "Illegal networks or criminal organizations: Power, roles and facilitators in four cocaine trafficking structures." In Third Annual Illicit Networks Workshop, Montreal. 2011
