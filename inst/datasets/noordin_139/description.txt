These data were drawn primarily from 'Terrorism in Indonesia: Noordin's Networks,' a publication of the International Crisis Group (2006) and include relational data on the 79 individuals listed in Appendix C of that publication.  The data represents 288 individuals in the Noordin Top terrorist network, originally constructed by Naval Postgraduate School students as part of the course 'Tracking and Disrupting Dark Networks', and reviewed by CORE Lab Research Assistant Daniel Cunningham.  The data represents information regarding the relationships between group members, where members had been educated, if members had been classmates, communication ties, kinship ties, training events that members had been a part of, business and finances that members had been involved in, operational ties, friendship ties, religious affiliation, if members had been soulmates, logistical locations, recorded meetings, and individual attributes (including leducation, nationality, previous military training, etc.).
