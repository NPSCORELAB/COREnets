These data were drawn primarily from two International Crisis Group (ICG) reports: “Terrorism in Indonesia: Noordin’s Networks” (International Crisis Group, 2006) and “Indonesia: Noordin Top’s Support Base” (International Crisis Group, 2009). The two ICG reports on Noordin contain rich one- and two-mode data on a variety of relations and affiliations (friendship, kinship, meetings, etc.) along with significant attribute data (education, group membership, physical status, etc.). The data were initially structured and analyzed by Naval Postgraduate School students in the course “Tracking and Disrupting Dark Networks” under the direction of Professor Sean Everton, Co-Director of the CORE Lab and Professor Nancy Roberts and then expanded and cleaned by Associate Faculty for Instruction, Dan Cunningham.
