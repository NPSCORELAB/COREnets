These data were made available through the John Jay & ARTIS Transnational Terrorism Database (JJATT), which hosts a collection network datasets pertaining to radical Islamists and their associates who have directly contributed to a terrorist attack. The undirected network is composed of 55 individuals and their evolving relationships over time. Relationships are coded into two two categories: general relationships and kinship. General relationships are coded on a scale of 0-3; '0' represents no relationship known (as such these relationships are not included in the cleaned data), '1' represents acquaintanceship or distant family ties, '2' represents friendship or moderately close family ties, '3' represents close friends or family. The current and past legal status of each individual is reflected as: free, in custody, or dead, and any associated arrest dates, release dates, or death dates.
