The paper "Social Networks of Drug Users in High-Risk Sites: Finding the Connections" (Weeks, Clair, Borgatti, Radda, Schenl, 2002) uses social network research to expand understanding of the social environment of drug users' health risks, particularly those associated with the transmission of HIV, hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted and bloodborne infectious diseases.  Researchers interviewed 293 drug users in the Hartford, Connecticut area from May 1998 to December 1999 to create ego-networks and macro-network linkages to determine the implications of network connections for peer-lead AIDs prevention intervention conducted in high-risk drug-use sites.  In particular by identifying existing channels for viral transfer, influence of peer norms and practices of risk-oriented behavior, and communication paths in which prevention methods can diffuse through exploring the relationships and interactions of drug users. In conclusion, the data was used to identify individuals in key locations of the largest connected network components as the most effective peer-educators due to their inherent centrality to the network.  While including strategic individuals within subgroups such as minority groups or women to effectively reach all areas of the network as peer-educators.
