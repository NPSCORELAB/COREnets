The network data depict a group of individuals associated with four attempted bomb attacks on July 21, 2005 that paralyzed London's mass transportation system- targeting Shepherd's Bush, Warren Street, and Oval stations on the London Underground, and on the London Buses on route 26 in Bethnal Green on Hackney Road. Operation Vivace offers clear insight into the role of mosques in radicalization (Herrington, 2015). This failed incident resulted in the arrest and prosecution of the would be bombers, which yielded a great deal of information on the cell's activities.  The failed attacks have been claimed by a group Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade, named after one of Osama bin Laden's lieutenants who was killed in 2001- but the legitimacy of this is disputed. The authors of these dataset, JJATT, gathered this data from using "open source" information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. Furthermore, as a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as dynamic and subject to changes.
