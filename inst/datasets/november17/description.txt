Using data observed from open source publications, the authors derived network data on the social network of the Greek terrorist group November17 (N17). The present data set represents a reconstruction of the data presented in the original paper, Inferring missing links in partially observed social network, put together by the UCINET team.  The data refers to a specific temporal window which runs from 1975 to 2002, and represents 22 members N17 with data derived from open-source reporting.  The data set RHODESBOMBING codes relationships between 22 members of N17, each tie is coded as '1'.  The data set RHODESBOMBIN_ATTR codes for three attributes of the 22 members of N17, which include: role, faction, and resources.  Role is coded with '1' denoting giving orders, and '2' denoting a person who recieves orders.  Both faction and resources are coded from 1 to 3. Attributes for factions are coded as:  '1' representing the 1st Generation Leadership Faction, '2' representing the Koufontinas Faction, '3' representing the Sardanopoulos Faction.  Resources attributes are coded as: '1' for controlling one resource, '2' for controlling two resources, and '3' for controlling three resources.
