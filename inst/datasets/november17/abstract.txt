The authors demostrate how social network topology can be inferred from following a limited observation of a large network. Essentially the issue is one of inferring the presence of links that are missed during a contrained data collection campaign on the network. It is particularly difficult to infer network structure for thos organizations that actively seek to remain covert and undetected. However, it is often very useful to know if two given individuals are likely to be connected even though limited surveillance efforts yield no evidence of a link. Specifically, the authors show how a statistical inference technique can be used to succesfully predict the existance of links that are missed during network sampling. The procedure is demostrated using data obtained from public source publications.
