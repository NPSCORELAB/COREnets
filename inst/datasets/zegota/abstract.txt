From 1942 to 1945, Zegota served as an underground organization of Polish resistance in German-occupied Poland (1942-1945). The authors explore how Zegota, an underground organization, served as a synchronizing element in this broader network. Specifically, the ability to 'galvanize conditional actors to lead, manage and fascilitate a collection of networks toward a unified objective'. While, the individual organizations that make up this network were developed to provide security, gather food, coordinate excapes, rescue children, provide education, and counter anti-Jewish propaganda to name a few, until the formation of Zegota in 1942 none served to aid Jews. The authors of this research focused on how Zegota synchronized the efforts of multiple organizations to achieve a particular goal.
