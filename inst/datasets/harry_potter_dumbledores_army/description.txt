This data set was used in the article, Strong Ties and Where to Find Them: Or, Why Neville (and Ginny and Seamus) and Bellatrix (and Lucius) Might Be More Important than Harry and Tom (Everton, Everton, Green, Homblin, Schroeder, 2019), and draws from J.K. Rowling’s seven Harry Potter books and other open-source data to code Dumbledore’s Army as a network.  Consisting of 29 members, Dumbledore’s Army’s undirected network of 282 ties represent trust and mutual understanding by each individual, being coded by tie strength between members of each network on a scale from 0 to 5, where ‘0’ indicates the absence of a tie, ‘1’ for casual acquaintances, and ‘5’ for kin and close friendships.
