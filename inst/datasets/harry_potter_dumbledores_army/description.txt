The authors draw from the J. K. Rowling's seven Harry Potter books and other open-source data to code two networks found in these novels - Dumbledore's Army and Voldemort's Death Eaters. Specifically, they identify 28 members of Dumbledore's Army and 25 Death Eaters (26 when Severus Snape is included). In this paper, they code tie strenght between members of each network on a scale from 0 to 5, where '0' indicates the absence of a tie, '1' for casual acquaintances, and '5' for kin and close friendships.
