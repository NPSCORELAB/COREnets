This data set was used in the article, 'Strong Ties and Where to Find Them: Or, Why Neville (and Ginny and Seamus) and Bellatrix (and Lucius) Might Be More Important than Harry and Tom.' (Everton, Everton, Green, Homblin, Schroeder, 2019), and draws from J.K. Rowling's seven Harry Potter books and other open-source data to code Voldemort's Death Eaters as an undirected network.  Consisting of 25 members (26 with the inclusion of Severus Snape) and 128 ties representing Death Eaters their loyalty to Voldemort.  Coded by tie strength between members of each network on a scale from 0 to 5, where '0' indicates the absence of a tie, with the rest of the ties being determined by the author's judgement of loyalty- most ties have been assigned a tie strength of 2, a small number receiving a tie strength of 4 and 5.  If a relationship between Death Eaters was unclear, the authors inferred relationships by participation in key activities and events.
