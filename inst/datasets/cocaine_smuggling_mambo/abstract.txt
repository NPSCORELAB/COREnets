These data refer to one of four illicit drug networks operating in Spain between 2007 and 2009. Operation MAMBO (n=22) began in 2006 and involved Colombian citizens that were introducing 50 kg of cocaine to be adulterated and distributed in Madrid (Spain). Ultimately, the group was involved in smuggling cocaine from Colombia through Brazil and Uruguay to be distributed in Spain. This is a typical Spanish middle cocaine group acting as wholesale supplier between a South American importer group and retailers in Madrid.  The information is listed as coming from police wiretapping and meetings registered by police investigations of the dark network. This data was reconstructed from Jimenez-Salinas Framis, A. 'Illegal networks or criminal organizations: Power, roles and facilitators in four cocaine trafficking structures.' In Third Annual Illicit Networks Workshop, Montreal. 2011
