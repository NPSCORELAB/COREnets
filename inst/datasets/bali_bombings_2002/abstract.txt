These data depict the network of indiduals involved in the 2002 Bali bombings in the tourist district of Kuta on Bali, Indonesia. This incident claimed the lives of 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 23 Britons, and 20 more people of differing nationalities), and injuring 209 more individuals. The authors of this dataset, JJATT, gathered this data from using "open source" information. The present dataset reflects a combination of familial, friendship, and association relationships. Furthermore, as a dynamic dataset these relationships are depicted as dynamic and subject to changes. The attack on October 12, 2002, has been attributed to Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamist extremist group dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state in Southeast Asia that has links to Al-Qaeda.  A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device inside of Paddy’s Pub, a local establishment popular with Australian and Western tourists, causing individuals to flee into the street where a second car bomb was detonated. A third device was detonated outside of the United States consulate in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, but was significantly smaller and caused minimal damage and no deaths.  Motivation for the attack is believed to be in response to support for the United State’s War on Terror and Australia’s role in the liberation of East Timor. This was the first of a series of terrorist attacks committed by Jemaah Islamiyah targeting Australians and Westerners.
