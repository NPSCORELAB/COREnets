Despite acknowledgment of ‘hybrid’ street gangs in the literature, there is little systematic research into ethnic heterogeneity within gangs. This dataset was generated by researchers aiming at moving beyond the broad categorization of the Black street gang. For this purpose, they examine an all-Black Londonbased gang in detail, using fieldwork and police arrest data, and investigate the role of ethnic heterogeneity for the workings of the gang. Findings suggest that ethnic heterogeneity within this gang is crucial for its criminal operation. Although there is no evidence for ethnicity-related  specialization of crime, the structural co-offending pattern of the gang’s activities is dominated by ethnicity.
