These data were reconstructed by Gemma Edwards using FIFA's Committee 2006 activity report. Each actor was tied to a standing committee in a bimodal network. The data procurred from UCINET's site (https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/covert-networks/fifa) stored these networks as one-mode graphs in which actors (people) are inteconnected via "co-membership" ties.
