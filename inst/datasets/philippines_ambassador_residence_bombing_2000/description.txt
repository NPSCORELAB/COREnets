These data were made available through the John Jay & ARTIS Transnational Terrorism Database (JJATT), which hosts a collection network datasets pertaining to radical Islamists and their associates who have directly contributed to a terrorist attack. The present data depict a time series of a network of individuals involved in the 2000 Philipine consulate bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia. This undirected network is composed of individuals and their relationships and legal status over time. Relationships are coded into two categories: general relationships and kinship.  General relationships are coded on a scale of 0-3; '0' represents no relationship known (as such these relationships are not included in the cleaned data), '1' represents acquaintanceship or distant family ties, '2' represents friendship or moderately close family ties, '3' represents close friends or family. The current and past legal status of each individual is reflected as: free, in custody, or dead, and any associated arrest dates, release dates, or death dates.
