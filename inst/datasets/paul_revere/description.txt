These data were reconstructed by the UCINET team by looking at the organizational affiliation information in the appendix of the book "Paul Revere's Ride" published by David Fischer (1994). The original data retireved from the UCINET site included two files, one 2-mode (254x7) affiliation matrix linking people to organizations, and one 1-mode matrix (254x254) shared membership matrix linking people to people. The data included here includes the bipartite relationships, as these can be used to generate person to person relationships.
