These data were reconstructed by the UCINET team by looking at the organizational affiliation information in the appendix of the book "Paul Revere's Ride" published by David Fischer (1994). The original data retrieved from the UCINET site included two files, one 2-mode (254x7) affiliation matrix linking people to organizations, and one 1-mode matrix (254x254) shared membership matrix linking people to people. The data included here includes the bipartite relationships, as these can be used to generate person to person relationships.  Organizational membership refers to an individual's membership to one of seven different organizations in the Boston area (St. Andrews Lodge, Loyal Nine, North Caucus, Long Room Club, Tea Party, Boston Committee, or London Enemies).
