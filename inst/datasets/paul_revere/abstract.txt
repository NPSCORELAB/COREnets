This dataset refers to Paul Revere, who's role in the events leading up to the American revolution remains a matter of American mythology. For their part, analysts and historians have delved into this matter. In "Paul Reverse's Ride", author David Fischer explores the historical events that lead up to the the emergence of the American republic. From this analysis, network researchers Han Shin-Kap, and Kieran Healy, have reconstructed networks from group membership to key Whig groups during this period of time. By recreating the social network of relationships relevant to the creation of the Sons of Liberty, Paul Revere’s revolutionary militia group located in Boston, researchers discerned the importance of Paul Revere’s brokerage role in the start of the revolution.  Through these network depictions, they have been able to address questions from a social structural perspective and answer questions on Revere's role in the mobilization process.
